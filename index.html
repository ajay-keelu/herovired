                Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or
                 universe. "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the 
                physical world, and also to life in general. The study 
                of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science.
                Although humans are part of nature, human activity is 
                often understood as a separate category from other natural 
                phenomena.The word nature is borrowed from the Old French
                nature and is derived from the Latin word natura, or
                "essential qualities, innate disposition", 
                and in ancient times, literally meant "birth".
                In ancient philosophy, natura is mostly used as 
                the Latin translation of the Greek word physis
                , which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics of plants,
                animals, and other features of the world to develop of their own 
                accord.The concept of nature as a whole,
                the physical universe, is one of several
                expansions of the original notion;it began with certain core
                applications of the word by pre-Socratic philosophers (though this word had a dynamic dimension then, especially for Heraclitus), 
                and has steadily gained currency ever since.
